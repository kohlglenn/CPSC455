## Project Description

A crowdsourced (friendsourced) restaurant finder: Put a group of friends in a lobby together and have them vote yes/no on restuarants within X km. At the end, show the list that everyone voted yes on (or use some other metrics to determine a single winner).  

**Who is it for?**: Friends who want to go out to eat but do not know where.  

**What will it do?**: Display restaurants based on prozimity to the users and collect their preferences for said restaurants.  

**What type of data will it store?**:  
* Account system for logging in
* For each account will save some statistics (logins, restaurants swiped, blacklisted restaurants)
* For each group/lobby will save some statistics (previously visited restaurants)  

**What will users be able to do with this data?**:  
* Log into the app
* Invite other users to a restaurant group and start a voting session
* View their individual and group statistics  

**What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?**:  
* Group and individual statistics seem to be the easiest to remove as it doesn't impact the MVP much.
